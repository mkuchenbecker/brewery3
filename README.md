# brewery3

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/mkuchenbecker/brewery3/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/mkuchenbecker/brewery3?branch=master)

brewery3 is a project to build a modular microservice RaspberryPi brewery.

It's the third set of brewery software I've built. Brewery1 was an arduino brewery,
and brewery2 was a RaspberryPi python brewery with a Django frontend.
